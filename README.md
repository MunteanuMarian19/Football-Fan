Please note that some statistics may not be available due to the limitations of the free API database. The API used in this project has certain constraints on the amount and types of data accessible. As a result, you may encounter instances where specific stats are unavailable or limited. I appreciate your understanding as i work within these constraints to provide you with the best possible football data experience.
